I am currently 18 and studying my first year of Bachelor of Information Technology. I got into IT because I am always playing games and on my computer so I wanted to do a profession that required me to use a computer to complete the tasks and also the fact that with IT you are able to do so many things just by using codes which I find interesting. IT also has a bright future as technology is advancing at a fast rate and so there would be a need for more individuals who can code, and I would like to help with the advancement of technology/</span></span></span></p>
<p style='margin-right:0cm;margin-left:0cm;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;margin-top:12.0pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><span style="color:black;">I am good at socialising and communicating with individuals as well as groups which I am able to make friends and make people feel more comfortable very easily. I am also able to understand people&#39;s feelings and thoughts once I get to know them. My concentration is another good thing as once I&rsquo;ve started on the work, I would be focused on completing the work without getting distracted at all and coming up with solutions is another thing I&rsquo;m good at as I am creative to an extent and very logical. I am interested in Cyber Security as the future would be relying on technology very heavily and I would like to feel secure with the technology I use so Cyber Security would be able to assist me in creating a program that would allow users to feel safe from any cyber-attacks.</span></span></span></p>

Another weak point is that I don&rsquo;t have the motivation to start doing the work as I am generally a lazy person however once I do then all my focus would be on the task.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style='font-size: 16px; line-height: 107%; font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif; color: black;'>I would be assisting other group members with their work if it&rsquo;s too much and they ask for help or come up with solutions to problems that occur during the project.</span></p>
