<p style='margin-right:0cm;margin-left:0cm;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;margin-top:12.0pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'><span style='color: black; font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 16px;'>Our idea, FlippingRooms, is an Augmented Reality mobile app for interior design for both professionals and general people. FlippingRooms, is an app that allows users to organise their rooms using Augmented Reality on their smartphones and tablets to redecorate, remove and redesign their rooms. This will allow users to move furniture and decorations without having to physically move everything in the room. This will be done by taking a photo of the room from various angles and making it into a 2D diagram which can be interacted with. Users will have the ability to move the furniture around or even remove them to design the room to how they see fit. This will make interior designing tools much simpler and accessible for the general population while also being an effective tool for professionals.</span></p>
