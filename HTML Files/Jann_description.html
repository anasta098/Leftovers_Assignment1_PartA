<p style='margin-right:0cm;margin-left:0cm;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;margin-top:12.0pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><span style="color:black;">I was born in the Philippines and moved to New Zealand when I was 4. I eventually moved over to Australia at the age of 10 however I still hold a New Zealand passport. Whilst I am not in my first year of study like my fellow group mates, I have been studying part time whilst balancing work. I have bounced from course to course however my long interest in IT has brought me here. My passion in IT like many others stems from the wonder of its ever-evolving nature and the improved&nbsp;quality of life that we all get to experience as a result of these advancements.</span></span></span></p>

My greatest interest lies in Cyber Security as I believe it is of utmost importance in this day and age. As I currently work in a bank, I have encountered individuals who have fallen victim to cyber-attacks and scams, which has only further emphasized security&rsquo;s importance and grown my interest.</span></span></span></p>

My overall workload including work and study may also leave me overwhelmed at some point, but I am confident in my ability to find a balance and manage both effectively and see the project through to completion.</span></span></span></p>

However with the group all seeming to lack confidence in our coding skills, I hope to take on a partial role as a programmer so that I may learn and improve my skills.</span></p>
