I am 100% Chinese. After graduating from college, I worked for a while and found that I wanted to continue studying. After much consideration, I decided to come to Australia and learn IT-related knowledge. In the near future, I hope to become a cybersecurity Engineer, because I admire the profession of hacking very much, but after all it is illegal. By the way I like the Australian air and environment, although my nose suffers from pollen every day.</span></span></span></p>

But I had never been exposed to any knowledge related to IT before I entered the school. Now when I came into contact with IT, I thought it was too difficult to be a hacker. Maybe that kind of computer genius only appears in movies. However, I didn&#39;t want to give up. When I came to RMIT, I made my goal clearer. I wanted to develop towards network security. If I can&#39;t hack into someone else&#39;s system anytime, anywhere, I create a system that can&#39;t be hacked.</span></span></span></p>

Although my weakness is very fatal, I will try my best to improve it.</span></span></span></p>

I have a good talent for data research and analysis. I have undertaken most of the research work in the previous group work. I am willing to work for my team as part of the team.</span></p>
