<p><strong>Project Risks</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Risk: Project features and purpose are not well-defined</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> Features might not be as accessible to one client as it is to another. For example, cataloguing is a feature that might give the most trouble due to needing to accommodate for a wide range of customers. Furthermore, we might stray from the original purpose of being a furniture decoration app due to not defining our targeted audience or wanting to please everyone.</p>

<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> We can mitigate this by having a work plan that labels the core needs and purpose of the app. By doing this, we would look to this work plan before deciding to add any features or if we are uncertain about changing something. Furthermore, all work would be looked through before proceeding to the next development phase.</p>

<p><strong>2. Risk: Project design and deliverable definition is incomplete</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example: </strong>Members or the whole group are not able to complete the project or reach a milestone due to problems like time constraints or lack of skills therefore rendering the project incomplete as it would be missing planned features. This could also refer to a part of the project not adhering to the core principles of said project, which would make it incomplete.</p>

<p><strong>Mitigation: </strong>To prevent this, we can set up a schedule and proper workload for each member in accordance to their expertise. Furthermore, if any of the members need help or canâ€™t complete their part, they are welcome to ask the team for assistance in a collaborative chat available to everyone in the group. </p>

<p><strong>3. Risk: Project schedule is not clearly defined or understood</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example: </strong>The assigned workload or time conflicts with members' availability and may result in confusion. Another example would be if a deadline isn't made clear and not everyone would be ready to present their work.</p>

<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> This can be prevented by having a meeting before starting the project, with all members working out a schedule that fits everyone's schedule. After that, the schedule is accessible by all members and if there are conflicts, it can be revised in another meeting or informing every one of the changes. </p>
