IT interests me as it is something, I use every day and as such I would like to learn more about it. I have been interested in IT since year 11 where I did some coding in my computing class. I found creating and making my own programs interesting and intriguing and as such decided to continue this curiosity in University. I also thought that the job security along with the pay that comes with the IT industry would be good for my future.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

Design is something that I have enjoyed in previous classes and I am just naturally a creative person. I think this allows us to have a variety of outlooks on things and can mean that we can tackle different problems in a creative way. As I am also outgoing, I believe that my communication skills will also be helpful in working with a group and make it more enjoyable. I&rsquo;m interested in helping people and making their lives easier in any way and using my knowledge from the course I am doing is something I believe will be extremely joyful.</span></span></span></p>

I have enjoyed programming however I think there is lots for me to learn, which I am excited about. Programming is something that I have done in my spare time and would like to learn more about however it is also something I expect to improve on.</span></span></span></p>

I think I will help my group by using my creativity to help solve problems from a different perspective or coming up with ideas which will help our group.</span></p>
