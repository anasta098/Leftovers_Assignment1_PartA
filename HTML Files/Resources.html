<p><strong>3. Communication Expectations</strong></p>
<p>Group members are expected to check their emails and constantly be checking Microsoft Teams to ensure they know what is going on with the group project. They will also need to check Trello to update the board cards to allow other group members to know where they are up to. If any group member is stuck or needs clarification on the work given to them, they will need to ask for assistance from other group members as soon as possible and not leave it to the last minute. Group meetings will be held regularly and are expected for all members to attend unless they have an event on or a problem has occurred which they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to attend. Group meetings would usually be assigned to dates where every group member is free and able to attend. Outside of group meetings, members are expected to use Microsoft Teams chat function to message each other about group work.</p>
<p><strong>4. Decision-making Processes</strong></p>
<p>For decision-making and the resolution of disputes, we have collectively agreed to discuss with everyone where possible. We have scheduled weekly meetings during which all members may voice their opinions and concerns, and after discussing and voting, a decision can be made. As mentioned within our communication expectations, if anything comes up throughout the week, each member should be available at some point of the day on Microsoft Teams so that any pressing concerns may be swiftly addressed.</p>
