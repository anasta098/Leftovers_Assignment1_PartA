<p style='margin-right:0cm;margin-left:0cm;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;margin-top:12.0pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><span style="color:black;">I was born in Vietnam and lived there for 10 years before moving to Australia with my family, and I am now a freshman at RMIT University at the age of 19. My interests in IT are mainly in programming and video games development, though I am also interested in other areas and am willing to try new things out of my comfort zone. My passion in IT stems from the fact that I am amazed at the wonders of technology and how it helped us in advancing our civilisation. It is because of this wonder and amazement that I hope to one day become a part of the leading figures that spearhead cutting edge technology.</span></span></span></p>

Other than that, I am versatile in that I can help with most work so I can provide help when needed. I also think my communication skills are good enough to keep cohesion in a group project. Other than that, I think my comprehension is one of my greatest strengths as I can usually interpret information clearly and help solve problems more efficiently and quickly.</span></span></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:0cm;margin-left:0cm;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;margin-top:12.0pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><span style="color:black;">That would be designing and coding. While I hold an interest and passion for programming, I am not particularly good at it. Furthermore, my creativity isn&rsquo;t a part of my strength which means I am less likely to contribute to the design process of the project.</span></span></span></p>

While I don&rsquo;t specialise in anything, I can help with solving problems the group encounters. Otherwise, I will probably be mainly focusing on whatever my delegated task is.</span></p>
