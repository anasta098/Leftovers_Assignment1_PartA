<h2><strong>Team-Dynamics Risk</strong></h2>

<p><strong>1. Risk: No control over members’ priorities</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example: </strong>Members might not be aware that their part of the project takes priority over others or is needed by another member. This could mean that no one has control over members’ work and therefore might cause frustration or arguments since it could mean the work would be submitted late.</p>

<p><strong>Mitigation: </strong>To prevent this, weekly meetings would make sure to check on everyone’s work and repeatedly inform members that have high priority work. Furthermore, everyone should be reminded of the deadline and what needs to be done before it. </p>

<p><strong>2. Risk: Unplanned work that must be accommodated</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example: </strong>Missing features or functionality due to any type of error, therefore adding to everyone’s work time due to the need to accommodate the changes. This can cause stress or frustration as everyone would need to make up for someone’s mess.</p>

<p><strong>Mitigation: </strong>Can be easily mitigated through the same methods above. Weekly meetings can be used to monitor members’ progress and sort out any errors brought up. Furthermore, each version of the app should be tested and verified by everyone in the group to make sure no errors are missed. </p>

<p><strong>3. Risk: Lack of communication, causing lack of clarity and confusion</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example: </strong>Everyone can be working on their own parts without communicating with other members to check if their part is correct or not. This could result in a mess as each members’ work might not combine into a cohesive and functional app which means everyone would have to rework their part at the last minute. Furthermore, lack of communication could result in lower morale as everyone might feel like they are the only one doing work.</p>

<p><strong>Mitigation: </strong>Again, easily mitigated through weekly meetings. Furthermore, a chat would also be available for everyone to join in and ask questions at any time. The meetings would ensure that everyone’s work fit the criteria and allow for a smooth development of the app. </p>
